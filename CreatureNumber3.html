        <h1>The Spiky-Nosed Ghost Shark</h1>

        <p>The spiky-nosed ghost shark, also known as *Harriotta raleighana* or the pointed-nose chimaera, is a fascinating and
        elusive deep-sea creature. Belonging to the order Chimaeriformes, itâ€™s not a true shark but a relative, sharing ancestry
        with sharks and rays. This ghost shark is named for its distinctive pointed snout, covered in sensory pores that help it
        detect prey in the dark depths of the ocean, often over 200 meters below the surface. Its smooth, pale body, with large,
        reflective eyes adapted for low light, gives it an otherworldly appearance. Feeding on mollusks, small fish, and
        crustaceans, the spiky-nosed ghost shark uses its tooth plates to crush hard shells. Despite its intimidating name, this
        creature is harmless to humans, but like many deep-sea species, it remains vulnerable to habitat disturbance and bycatch
        in deep-water fisheries. Its mysterious nature continues to intrigue scientists, highlighting the wonders hidden in the
        ocean's depths.</p>

        <p>The Spiky-Nosed Ghost Shark (*Hydrolagus erithacus*) was first discovered in 2016 off the coasts of South Africa and
        Madagascar. This rare deep-sea species is part of the chimaera family, a group of cartilaginous fish closely related to
        sharks and rays. It is distinguished by its long, spiky snout and smooth, ghostly body, which earned it its eerie
        nickname. Scientists discovered the species during deep-sea trawling expeditions aimed at exploring the largely unknown
        biodiversity of the ocean floor. Although its existence was noted in 2016, it was formally described and named in 2020,
        underscoring the challenges of studying deep-sea creatures.</p>
